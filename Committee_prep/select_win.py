PhysioNet 2020 Challenge

This code finds the best window (5-second) in the signal to be used for training and later for the classifier
This code uses only lead #2 (data[1][indx:indx+2500]) of 12-lead signal
MRH May 21, 2020; 

This code was updated for data augmentation. It will select more windows from the signals with lower occurance in dataset. The new 
function named select_windows is for this new selection.
July 14, 2020 

inputs:
	- input_directory: the directory containing the files
	- file_name
	- win_size: with default set to 5 second
output:
	- The address (index of signal array) for starting the window (one interger number)
Functions:
	- butter_bandpass: for bandpass filtering, used in butter_bandpass_forward_backward_filter
	- butter_bandpass_forward_backward_filter: for forward_backward filtering

	- *** NEEDS TO IMPORT Detectors, panPeakDetect, searchBack functions from ecg_detectors.ecgdetectors 
	- Note: These functions are borrowed from the github account: https://github.com/marianpetruk/ECG_analysis
To see the selected window for a signal:
	uncomment the line before the last line :)
	# plot1v(data[1],[start_window, start_window + win_size * fs],fs)
Future work: 
	- Trying differnt statistics and rules for selecting window
