Visual-Explanation-of-Atari
==

Tensorflow Implementation of Visualizing and Understanding Atari Agents that is a novel methodology for interpreting decision of agent trained under the reinforcement learning framework. The original pytorch implemetation is in https://github.com/greydanus/visualize_atari.

## Reference paper
**"Visualizing and Understanding Atari Agents"**. Sam Greydanus, Anurag Koul, Jonathan Dodge and Alan Fern (https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00138)

## Running Examples
![actor_breakout.gif](assets/actor_breakout.gif)
![critic_breakout.gif](assets/critic_breakout.gif)

## Environment
We will use the OpenAI Gym environment. OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. https://gym.openai.com/envs/#atari

## Pretrained Models
We provided pretrained models for the game of "breakout" and "pong".
These models were obtained using [this repo](https://github.com/NVlabs/GA3C) (default hyperparameters).

## How to Use

```bash
$ cd Visual-Explanation-of-Atari 
$ python main.py -m critic -e BreakoutDeterministic-v0 --first_frame 350 --num_frames 100
```

## Requirements 
+ tensorflow (1.4.0)
+ numpy (1.15.0)
+ matplotlib (2.2.2)
